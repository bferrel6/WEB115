			<p>
				I, <a href="introduction.html" class="tanLink">Benjamin E Ferrell</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2023 WEB115 Course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. 
				I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
				As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates' code directly. 
				I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
